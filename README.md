# Shotgun-King-Achievement-Hunter
A simple assistant to get most achievements in the game Shotgun King

## Note
With the updates to the game, this is no longer up to date.  Feel free to fork this repository. 

## How it works
This program uses computer vision to try to extract the cards owned.  For there it is a matter of a simple algorithm to decide which cards are best for choosing.

## Issues
Not all the achivements have been inputted but rather just the list from GameData/achievements.txt.  This was done since the algorithm uses 3 cards set for the best choices.
